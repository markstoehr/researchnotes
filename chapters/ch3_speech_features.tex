\section{Mel Spectral Features}
\label{sec:mel-spectral-features}

Mel spectral features are generally formed using a filterbank
whose center frequencies increase exponential and whose 
bandwidths are increasing along the frequency axis.  They are
centered such that they are linear with the mel scale given
by the equation
\begin{equation}
mel(f) = 2595 \log_{10}\left(1 + \frac{f}{700}\right)
\end{equation}
which is given in \cite{wiki:mel_scale}.
