\section{Smart Things}
The idea of smart objects are that you would have economic agents which
are objects. An example would be cars. A car might be blockchain aware
and could lock itself up and be unlockable by one bitcoin address
and then be only unlockable by another address based on a particular
bitcoin transaction. This solves the important security problem that one might
move the bitcoins but there is no guarantee the other party will relinquish
their property.

You might also develop secure hardware as intermediaries to trade bitcoins
so that way you can have features like reversable transactions built on
top of bitcoins.  The secure hardware aspect would allow independent and 
trustless verification.
