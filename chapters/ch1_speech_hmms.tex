\subsection{HVite for Forced Alignment}

In order to bootstrap we need to have state labels to classify the deep
neural network into the state labels we need a viterbi forced alignment
to get the state labels.  These are obtained in the HTK tools using
\texttt{HVite}.  The command we use is
\begin{verbatim}
$HTKTools/HLEd -n trainTriphones -l '*' -i trainTri.mlf mktri.led trainMono.mlf

HVite -a -b h# -f -i forced_dev.mlf -H -I
HVite  -T 1 -C work/hvite.config -H work/tri-nmix48-npass4/MMF -S work/dev.scp -I work/trainTri.mlf -i faout.mlf dict tiedlist 
\end{verbatim}
